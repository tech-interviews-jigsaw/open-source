    "I've been looking at [this issue](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/issues/8797) where apparently upper case columns are breaking with core expectations like [expect_column_values_to_not_be_null](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/blob/develop/great_expectations/expectations/core/expect_column_values_to_not_be_null.py).  \n",
    "\n",
    "After investigating, I was looking to see where in GE the query was executed against the database.  The closest I could find get to the query logic is the `column_condition_partial` , which [the docs](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/guides/expectations/creating_custom_expectations/how_to_create_custom_column_map_expectations/) say should be implemented with each `ColumnMapExpectation` .  It doesn't look like it's in the [expect_column_values_to_not_be_null](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/blob/develop/great_expectations/expectations/core/expect_column_values_to_not_be_null.py) expectation.  \n",

    "Any ideas as to where the logic of the database query is executed, or other pointers as to where I should be looking?\n",

    "Let's look at other core expectations to see how they are implemented.  That is, where is the actual business logic.  For example, if we look at [this expectation](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/blob/develop/contrib/experimental/great_expectations_experimental/expectations/expect_column_to_have_no_days_missing.py), the core piece is in the `@metric` decorated functions.  Perhaps there is something similar in our or other breaking expectations, or the classes they inherit from."
